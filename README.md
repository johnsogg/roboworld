# Roboworld

A choose-your-own-adventure game

## Plot

The player wakes up to find themselves on a strange alien world populated by
robots. They seem content to execute their programming, except they have
forgotten how to do many things, like how to run the trains.

The player's goal is to speak with the robots and learn from them, and then fix
various problems. When the player solves the robot problems, they remember how
to run the train and the player can progress.
